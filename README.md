# topologicalinsulator
Very bad code for class AIII disordered topological insulators \
Requires OpenMP, Lapack, Blas libararies \
TM3D is not working \
Chernnumber1d, Chernnumber3d, magneticfield (3d): create phase diagram data, multithreaded \
transfermatrix1d, tm3d: create lyapunov exponent data for phase diagram, multithreaded \
processing: uses data to create phase diagram
